t# ImLazy frontend app

ImLazy was at the beggining only a Node.js bot using Puppeteer module to invite workaway members in the area to meetup.
Then it evolved with a ReactJs UI and now taking a "SAAS template" form. (auth, user management...)

This project correspond to the frontend app, linked to the [**ImLazy** backend API](https://github.com/baptistesx/im-lazy-backend).
[**ReactJs**](https://fr.reactjs.org/) framework is used with [**MUI**](https://mui.com/), [\*\*React Router DOM](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), [**React Hook Form**](https://react-hook-form.com/).
